            <h3>What is the difference between each Edition?</h3>
            <p>
              Every Edition offers the same core functionality. Distinct Editions offer cosmetic variations on various
              integrations and drops; a different level of scarcity; and occasional Edition-exclusive benefits offered
              by the Edition artist/s.

            <h3>What are the benefits of holding a Metakey?</h3>
            <p>
              The Metakey is the NFT that keeps on giving. We are committed to packing each Edition with magnitudes of
              value beyond the original mint price. The benefits accumulate exponentially the longer you hold!

            <h3>When is the next Metakey Edition?</h3>
            <p>
              The next Metakey Edition will not be released before the value of the current Edition is solidified, nor
              before demand has organically reached the point that the current Edition is no longer accessible to new
              users.
